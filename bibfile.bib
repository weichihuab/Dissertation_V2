	abstract = {We study three-dimensional generalizations of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect. Unlike two dimensions, where a single Z2 topological invariant governs the effect, in three dimensions there are 4 invariants distinguishing 16 phases with two general classes: weak (WTI) and strong (STI) topological insulators. The WTI are like layered 2D QSH states, but are destroyed by disorder. The STI are robust and lead to novel “topological metal” surface states. We introduce a tight binding model which realizes the WTI and STI phases, and we discuss its relevance to real materials, including bismuth.},

We name it as m-TaB4. The calculations of elastic constants and phonon dispersion confirm that m-TaB4 is mechanical and dynamical stable. Further calculations predicate that this structure is an ultrahard material with a large hardness (29GPa). The presence of strong covalent boron–boron bonds and planar six-membered ring boron network in m-TaB4 are crucial for its high hardness.}

abstract = {The structural formation, elastic properties, hardness and electronic structure of TMB4 (TM=Cr, Re, Ru and Os) compounds are investigated using first-principles approach. The value of C22 for these compounds is almost two times bigger than the C11 and C33. The intrinsic hardness, shear modulus and Young's modulus are calculated to be in a sequence of CrB4>ReB4>RuB4>OsB4, and the Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio of TMB4 follow the order of CrB4<ReB4<RuB4<OsB4. The intrinsic hardness of CrB4 and ReB4 by LDA is bigger than 40GPa. The high hardness of TMB4 compounds is derived from the feature of B–B bonds cage and higher C22 value. The B–B covalent bonds as bonds cage enhances the resistance to shear deformation and improve the hardness. We predict that the TMB4 compounds with CrB4-type are the potential superhard materials.}

JARVIS is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles of developing open-access databases and tools to reduce the cost and development time of materials discovery, optimization, and deployment. The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ≈40,000 materials and ≈1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ≈500 materials and ≈110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ≈25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm. The JARVIS datasets and tools are publicly available at the website: https://jarvis.nist.gov.},

abstract={High-throughput density functional theory (HT DFT) is fast becoming a powerful tool for accelerating materials design and discovery by the amassing tens and even hundreds of thousands of DFT calculations in large databases. Complex materials problems can be approached much more efficiently and broadly through the sheer quantity of structures and chemistries available in such databases. Our HT DFT database, the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), contains over 200,000 DFT calculated crystal structures and will be freely available for public use at http://oqmd.org. In this review, we describe the OQMD and its use in five materials problems, spanning a wide range of applications and materials types: (I) Li-air battery combination catalyst/electrodes, (II) Li-ion battery anodes, (III) Li-ion battery cathode coatings reactive with HF, (IV) Mg-alloy long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) strengthening precipitates, and (V) training a machine learning model to predict new stable ternary compounds.},

The composition and structure of the materials are self-consistently established by optically detected x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and both x-ray diffraction and Raman measurements on the same samples give independent confirmation of their chemical and structural purity: together, the results are therefore considered as providing definitive measurements of the optical band-gap energies of the two materials.}

abstract={Six compositions of 1 mol {\%} Dy3+-doped multicomponent borate glasses containing single Li2O, Na2O, K2O and mixed Li2O--Na2O, Li2O--K2O, and Na2O--K2O oxides have been synthesized by well-known melt-quenching technique. Following the measured density and refractive index values, various physical parameters were estimated for all the glass samples and differences in them are correlated with structural changes. To explore optical properties like absorption edge ($\lambda$cut-off), optical band gap energy (Eopt), and Urbach energy ($\Delta$E), optical absorption spectra were recorded for all the glasses. The Eg has been calculated using Davis and Mott theory for direct allowed, and indirect allowed transitions and the results were reported. The Eg values are also estimated using absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) method. The optical parameters variations have also been associated with the structural changes occurring in the glasses with different alkali/mixed alkali oxides content presence. The shielding properties of the prepared glasses were studied in terms of effective atomic numbers (Zeff), mean free path (MFP), half value layer (HVL) and macroscopic effective removal cross-section ($\Sigma$R). From these results, it was found that Potassium (K) glass shows superior gamma ray shielding properties due to a higher value of Zeff and lower values of both MFP and HVL. These results indicate that the prepared glasses might be utilized in place of some common shielding materials to shield $\gamma$-rays and neutrons.},

abstract={Time reversal symmetry (TRS) protects the metallic surface modes of topological insulators (TIs). The transport signature of such surface states is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of the insulating bulk with decreasing temperature. This universal behaviour is observed in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has been reported in several topological semimetals which exhibit TI universal resistivity behaviour only when breaking time reversal symmetry, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated as Weyl semimetals owing to their lack of inversion symmetry, Cd3As2 is known as a Dirac semimetal owing to its linear band crossing at the Fermi level, and WTe2 is termed a resonant compensated semimetal owing to its perfect electron--hole symmetry. Here we introduce LaSb, a simple rock-salt structure material that lacks broken inversion symmetry, perfect linear band crossing, and perfect electron--hole symmetry yet exhibits all the exotic field-induced behaviours of these more complex semimetals. It shows a field-induced universal TI resistivity with a plateau at roughly 15{\thinspace}K, ultrahigh mobility of carriers in the plateau region, quantum oscillations with the angle dependence of a two-dimensional Fermi surface, and XMR of about one million percent at 9{\thinspace}T. Owing to its structural simplicity, LaSb represents an ideal model system to formulate a theoretical understanding of the exotic consequences of breaking time reversal symmetry in topological semimetals.},

	abstract = {Extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has been recently discovered in a number of seemingly unrelated materials with diverse crystalline and electronic structures. In this work, we use lanthanum monopnictides, LaBi and LaSb, as simple platforms to reveal a common triangular Temperature{\textendash}field phase diagram for XMR. Further, we show that, in the electronic structure of both materials, lanthanum d orbitals mix with the pnictogen p orbitals. Remarkably, we find that both the triangular phase diagram and the orbital texture exist in all families of semimetals with XMR. These results show that XMR is a ubiquitous phenomenon with a universal phase diagram that goes beyond certain material specifications; it is not a rare commodity of topological materials or noncentrosymmetric structures.The recent discovery of extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) in LaSb introduced lanthanum monopnictides as a new platform to study this effect in the absence of broken inversion symmetry or protected linear band crossing. In this work, we report XMR in LaBi. Through a comparative study of magnetotransport effects in LaBi and LaSb, we construct a temperature-field phase diagram with triangular shape that illustrates how a magnetic field tunes the electronic behavior in these materials. We show that the triangular phase diagram can be generalized to other topological semimetals with different crystal structures and different chemical compositions. By comparing our experimental results to band structure calculations, we suggest that XMR in LaBi and LaSb originates from a combination of compensated electron-hole pockets and a particular orbital texture on the electron pocket. Such orbital texture is likely to be a generic feature of various topological semimetals, giving rise to their small residual resistivity at zero field and subject to strong scattering induced by a magnetic field.},

abstract={The rare-earth monopnictide LaBi exhibits exotic magneto-transport properties, including an extremely large and anisotropic magnetoresistance. Experimental evidence for topological surface states is still missing although band inversions have been postulated to induce a topological phase in LaBi. In this work, we have revealed the existence of surface states of LaBi through the observation of three Dirac cones: two coexist at the corners and one appears at the centre of the Brillouin zone, by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with ab initio calculations. The odd number of surface Dirac cones is a direct consequence of the odd number of band inversions in the bulk band structure, thereby proving that LaBi is a topological, compensated semimetal, which is equivalent to a time-reversal invariant topological insulator. Our findings provide insight into the topological surface states of LaBi's semi-metallicity and related magneto-transport properties.},

abstract={Recent debates in the literature over the relationship between topology and Extreme Magnetoresistance (XMR) have drawn attention to the Lanthanum Monopnictide family of binary compounds. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to measure the electronic structure of the XMR topological semimetal candidates LaBi, LaSb, and LaAs. The orbital content of the near-EFstates in LaBi and LaSb are extracted using varying photon polarizations and both dominant d and p bands are observed near X. The measured bulk bands are shifted in energy when compared to the results of Density Functional Calculations. This disagreement is minor in LaBi, but large in LaSb and LaAs. The measured bulk band structure of LaBi shows a clear band inversion and puts LaBi in the $\upsilon${\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 class of Topological Insulators (or semimetals), as predicted by calculations and consistent with the measured Dirac-like surface states. LaSb is on the verge of a band inversion with a less-clear case for any distinctly topological surface states and in disagreement with calculations. Lastly, these same bands in LaAs are clearly non-inverted implying its topological triviality and demonstrating a topological phase transition in the Lanthanum monopnictides. Using a wide range of photon energies the true bulk states are cleanly disentangled from the various types of surface states which are present. These surface states exist due to surface projections of bulk states in LaSb and for topological reasons in LaBi.},

We observe that the resistivity exhibits a pronounced minimum at a critical strain. We further find that the positive longitudinal magnetoconductance becomes maximal at the critical strain. This nonmonotonic strain dependence is consistent with the switching of sign of the Dirac mass and, hence, a strain-tuned topological phase transition in ZrTe5.},

abstract = {Lanthanum and lanthanum nitride thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering onto silicon wafers covered by natural oxide. {\it In situ} and real-time synchrotron radiation experiments during deposition reveal that lanthanum crystallizes in the face-centred cubic bulk phase. Lanthanum nitride, however, does not form the expected NaCl structure but crystallizes in the theoretically predicted metastable wurtzite and zincblende phases, whereas post-growth nitridation results in zincblende LaN. During deposition of the initial 2{--}3nm, amorphous or disordered films with very small crystallites form, while the surface becomes smoother. At larger thicknesses, the La and LaN crystallites are preferentially oriented with the close-packed lattice planes parallel to the substrate surface. For LaN, the onset of texture formation coincides with a sudden increase in roughness. For La, the smoothing process continues even during crystal formation, up to a thickness of about 6nm. This different growth behaviour is probably related to the lower mobility of the nitride compared with the metal. It is likely that the characteristic void structure of nitride thin films, and the similarity between the crystal structures of wurtzite LaN and La${\sb 2}$O${\sb 3}$, evoke the different degradation behaviours of La/B and LaN/B multilayer mirrors for off-normal incidence at 6.{\it x}nm wavelength.},

abstract = {wannier90  is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90  is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90  is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90  2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90  is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Phys. Comm. 178(2008)685 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions [2] from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled, and using these Wannier functions to calculate electronic properties of materials. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required [3, 4]. Reasons for new version: Addition of new functionality, minor bug fixes, and parallel (MPI) execution for parts of the code. Summary of revisions: Enhancements include: •Spinor projections•Improved plotting•Parallel execution•Calculation of van der Waals interactions•Landauer–Buttiker and Boltzmann transport Full details are given in the CHANGE.log file, which can be found in the root directory of the distribution. Additional comments: The distribution file for this program is over 47 MB and therefore is not delivered directly when Download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. Running time: Example calculations run in a few minutes. References: [1]A.A. Mostofi, J.R. Yates, Y.-S. Lee, I.

A detailed ab initio investigation of a multilayer consisting of alternating unit cells of LaSb and LaBi shows the presence of band inversion in the bulk and a massless Dirac cone on the (001) surface, which remains stable under the influence of time-reversal-preserving perturbations, thus confirming the topologically non-trivial nature of the multilayer in which the electronic properties can be tailored as per requirement.

We show that high-performance computers equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs) as accelerators may reduce drastically the computation time when offloading these sections to the graphic chips. The procedure consists of (i) profiling the performance of the code to isolate the time-consuming parts, (ii) rewriting these so that the algorithms become better-suited for the chosen graphic accelerator, and (iii) optimizing memory traffic between the host computer and the GPU accelerator. We chose to accelerate VASP with NVIDIA GPU using CUDA. We compare the GPU and original versions of VASP by evaluating the Davidson and RMM-DIIS algorithms on chemical systems of up to 1100 atoms. In these tests, the total time is reduced by a factor between 3 and 8 when running on n (CPU core + GPU) compared to n CPU cores only, without any accuracy loss. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Inclusion of exact-exchange increases the cost of density functional theory by orders of magnitude, motivating the use of GPUʼs. Porting the widely used electronic density functional code VASP to run on a GPU results in a 5–20 fold performance boost of exact-exchange compared with a traditional CPU. We analyze performance bottlenecks and discuss classes of problems that will benefit from the GPU. As an illustration of the capabilities of this implementation, we calculate the lattice stability α- and β-rhombohedral boron structures utilizing exact-exchange. Our results confirm the energetic preference for symmetry-breaking partial occupation of the β-rhombohedral structure at low temperatures, but does not resolve the stability of α relative to β."

The method employs the direct-method approach, where anharmonic force constants are extracted from the trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate cubic and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements. The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then, combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the whole method to a thermoelectric material Mg2Si and demonstrate the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with low thermal conductivities.}

Topological Dirac or Weyl semimetals show linear dispersion around nodes, termed the Dirac or Weyl points, as the three-dimensional analog of graphene. We review the basic concepts and compare these topological states of matter from the materials perspective with a special focus on Weyl semimetals. The TaAs family is the ideal materials class to introduce the signatures of Weyl points in a pedagogical way, from Fermi arcs to the chiral magnetotransport properties, followed by hunting for the type-II Weyl semimetals in WTe2, MoTe2, and related compounds. Many materials are members of big families, and topological properties can be tuned. As one example, we introduce the multifunctional topological materials, Heusler compounds, in which both topological insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals can be found. Instead of a comprehensive review, this article is expected to serve as a helpful introduction and summary by taking a snapshot of the quickly expanding field. }

In these semimetals, the conduction and the valence bands cross each other along a one-dimensional curve in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, and any perturbation that preserves a certain symmetry group (generated by either spatial symmetries or time-reversal symmetry) cannot remove this crossing line and open a full direct gap between the two bands. The nodal line(s) is hence topologically protected by the symmetry group, and can be associated with a topological invariant. In this review, (i) we enumerate the symmetry groups that may protect a topological nodal line; (ii) we write down the explicit form of the topological invariant for each of these symmetry groups in terms of the wave functions on the Fermi surface, establishing a topological classification; (iii) for certain classes, we review the proposals for the realization of these semimetals in real materials; (iv) we discuss different scenarios that when the protecting symmetry is broken, how a topological nodal line semimetal becomes Weyl semimetals, Dirac semimetals, and other topological phases; and (v) we discuss the possible physical effects accessible to experimental probes in these materials.},

	abstract = {Fermions—elementary particles such as electrons—are classified as Dirac, Majorana or Weyl. Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals—materials hosting Weyl fermions—were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.},

Using this classification, we show the existence of new 3D topological semimetals characterized by C4,6-protected double-Weyl nodes with quadratic in-plane (along kx,y) dispersion or C6-protected triple-Weyl nodes with cubic in-plane dispersion. We apply this theory to the 3D ferromagnet HgCr2Se4 and confirm it is a double-Weyl metal protected by C4 symmetry. Furthermore, if the direction of the ferromagnetism is shifted away from the [001] axis to the [111] axis, the double-Weyl node splits into four single Weyl nodes, as dictated by the point group S6 of that phase. Finally, we discuss experimentally relevant effects including the splitting of multi-Weyl nodes by applying a Cn breaking strain and the surface Fermi arcs in these new semimetals.},

We introduce an explicit tight-binding model for space groups 130 and 135. Space group 135 can host an intrinsic double Dirac semimetal with no additional states at the Fermi energy. This defines a symmetry-protected topological critical point, and we show that a uniaxial compressive strain applied in different directions leads to topologically distinct insulating phases. In addition, the double Dirac semimetal can accommodate topological line defects that bind helical modes. Connections are made to theories of strongly interacting filling-enforced semimetals, and potential materials realizations are discussed.},

In 3D systems without inversion symmetry, a gapless phase should appear between the two phases with a bulk gap. The gapless points are monopoles and antimonopoles (in k space), whose topological nature is the source of this gapless phase. In general, when the external parameter is changed from the ordinary insulator phase, two monopole-antimonopole pairs are created and the system becomes gapless. The gap-closing points (monopoles and antimonopoles) then move in the k space as the parameter is changed further. They eventually annihilate in pairs, with changing partners from the pair creations, and the system opens a gap again entering into the quantum spin Hall phase.},
